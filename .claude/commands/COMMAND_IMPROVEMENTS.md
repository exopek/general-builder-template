## ðŸŽ¯ Why These Changes Were Needed

During the implementation of 9 Privacy Section components for Builder.io, several recurring issues were identified that caused significant development time:

### Critical Issues Encountered:

1. **`.card` Class Conflict** (occurred 2x)
   - The `.card` class in `global.css` sets `background: var(--color-white)`
   - This overrode all custom backgrounds and gradients
   - Affected: `BaseContactCard`, `BasePrivacyQuickAction`
   - **Impact**: Visual bug, required component refactoring

2. **Missing Closing Div Tags** (occurred 6x)
   - When adding `backgroundColor` property, template structure changed
   - Pattern: outer div (backgroundColor) + inner div (container) = 2 closing tags
   - 6 of 9 components had missing closing tags
   - **Impact**: Build errors, broken layouts

3. **Contrast Problems** (occurred 3x)
   - Text colors not matching backgrounds
   - `text-white` on white backgrounds
   - `text-gray-900` too dark on `bg-gray-50`
   - **Impact**: Accessibility issues, content not readable

4. **Builder.io Registration Confusion** (1x major refactor)
   - Initially registered both Base and Section components
   - Created cluttered, confusing Builder.io editor
   - **Impact**: Poor UX, required removing 9 component registrations

5. **No Systematic Validation**
   - No checklist before commits
   - Issues discovered during testing, not development
   - **Impact**: Multiple fix commits, longer development time
