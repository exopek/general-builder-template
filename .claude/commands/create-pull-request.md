## üéØ Pull Request Workflow

### IMPORTANT: Always Create New Branch

**NEVER** commit directly to existing branches or add commits to existing PRs.
**ALWAYS** create a new branch from `main` for each separate PR.

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Checkout and Update Main Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

**Purpose**: Ensure you're starting from the latest main branch

### Step 2: Create New Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `fix/[description]` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/cookie-banner`)
- `feat/[description]` - New features (e.g., `feat/user-dashboard`)
- `refactor/[description]` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/design-tokens`)
- `docs/[description]` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/api-guide`)
- `chore/[description]` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/deps-update`)

**Examples:**
- `fix/header-button-visibility`
- `feat/cookie-consent-banner`
- `refactor/container-padding`

### Step 3: Stage and Commit Changes

```bash
git add [files]
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[type]: [Short descriptive title]

- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
- [Change 3]

[Optional: Additional context or explanation]

git commit -m "refactor: migrate to design token system"
```
